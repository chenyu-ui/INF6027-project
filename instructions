## Instructions for Running the Code

To replicate the air pollution data analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Software:**
   - **Git:** Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) appropriate for your operating system.
   - **R:** Download and install R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html).
   - **RStudio (Optional but Recommended):** Download and install RStudio from [rstudio.com](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and execute the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/INF6027-project.git
Alternatively, navigate to https://github.com/your-username/INF6027-project in your web browser, click the green Code button, select Download ZIP, and extract the contents to your desired location.

Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your working directory to the cloned repository by running:

bash
Copy code
cd INF6027-project
Open the Project in RStudio:

Launch RStudio.
Click on File > Open Project..., navigate to the cloned INF6027-project folder, and select the .Rproj file if available. If no project file exists, you can open the main R script directly by going to File > Open File... and selecting analysis_script.R.
Install Required R Packages: In the R console within RStudio, install the necessary packages by running:

r
Copy code
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape2", "lubridate", "dplyr", "corrplot", "writexl"))
This command installs ggplot2 for plotting, reshape2 for data reshaping, lubridate for date-time manipulation, dplyr for data manipulation, corrplot for correlation matrix visualization, and writexl for exporting data to Excel.

Prepare the Dataset:

Ensure you have the air_pollution.csv file. If you don't have it, obtain it from the project maintainer or relevant source.
Create a data folder within the project directory if it doesn't already exist:
bash
Copy code
mkdir data
Move the air_pollution.csv file into the data folder.
Update File Paths (If Necessary): Open analysis_script.R located in the R/ directory and verify that the file_path variable correctly points to the location of air_pollution.csv. It should look like this:

r
Copy code
file_path <- "data/air_pollution.csv"
Modify the path if your data file is located elsewhere.

Run the Analysis Script:

In RStudio, open analysis_script.R from the R/ folder.
Execute the script by clicking the Source button to run the entire script at once. Alternatively, you can run the script line-by-line or in sections by selecting the desired code and pressing Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (macOS).
Review the Outputs:

Generated Plots: Navigate to the outputs/ directory within the project folder to find the generated PNG files, such as Improved_Faceted_Plots.png and Correlation_Matrix.png.
Processed Data: The script may export cleaned and summarized data to the outputs/ folder or display them within the R environment. Look for files like daily_means_no_outliers.csv.
Console Messages: Monitor the R console for any warnings or messages indicating issues like missing values or file path errors.
