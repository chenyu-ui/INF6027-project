# INF6027 Project

## Introduction
In this project, I explore the relationships between various socioeconomic factors and public health outcomes. The research utilizes R for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Research Questions
1. How do income levels correlate with health outcomes?
2. Are there significant differences in rural vs. urban settings for certain health indicators?

## Key Findings
- Income levels show a strong positive correlation with certain health outcomes (e.g., life expectancy).
- Rural regions tend to have fewer healthcare facilities, impacting overall public health metrics.

## R Code
You can find the R scripts in the [`R/` folder](R/). The scripts include:
- `data_cleaning.R`: Prepares the dataset for analysis.
- `analysis.R`: Conducts statistical tests and generates plots.
- `report.Rmd`: An R Markdown report summarizing the findings.
